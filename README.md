# PhD Research Support Repository

This repository provides **supporting scripts, data, and experimental inputs** for the PhD research titled:

**A Fair, Flexible, Zero-Waste Digital Electricity Market:  
A First-Principles Approach Combining Automatic Market Making, Holarchic Architectures and Shapley Theory**

The full PhD thesis is available as a preprint on arXiv:

📄 https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13871

## Overview

The research develops a **digital-first re-architecture of electricity markets**, combining:

- Automatic Market Making (AMM) for real-time pricing and allocation  
- Holarchic system architectures for scalable, modular market design  
- Shapley-theoretic value allocation to ensure fairness and cost causation consistency  

The work is motivated by the need for electricity markets that are:
**fair by construction, flexible by design, and zero-waste in operation**, while remaining physically network-feasible.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains **supporting materials** for the PhD, including:

- Scripts used to generate and preprocess model inputs  
- Data files supporting simulations and case studies  
- Analysis and visualisation tools  
- Reproducible pipelines that feed into the models and results described in the thesis  

**The scripts provided here primarily generate inputs and supporting artefacts** for the models and analyses presented in the PhD, rather than duplicating the full theoretical development.
